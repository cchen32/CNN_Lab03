- Came up with plan
- looked at function of `public static long currentTimeMillis()`
- Corina suggested coming up with different arraylists of variable lengths and printing time before and after and finding the time it takes to print time
- Nada suggested way to find differences between the print statements and from subtracting the time it takes to print time from the difference, and to find average for each incrementation of arraylists.
- Nicole suggested to run multiple tests of the same event as to find the uncertainty and averge of each tests.

- Our trio read issues given by other thinkerens and revised plan accordingly.
- SearchDriver.java runs and linsearches and binsearches through a simple array
- The time is the same for both linsearch and binsearch (difference of 0)

- Wrote two methods for average of Linear Search and average of Binary Search
- Tested cases of 100,000,000 and 500,000,000 (seemingly too much for two arrays but worked before for singular array)
- Decided that there's no need to populate arrays with new numbers for each new tests because it won't change the way Linear Search and Binary Search is ran.
- We run each tests multiple times, and Binary Search is faster most of the time.
