Time Spent: 0.5 hr

DISCOS:
- public static long currentTimeMillis()
- linear search increases in time exponentially as the array size does so

QCCS:
- difference between currentTimeNanos()?
- is binary search working too well?
- What causes the initial lag?

GALLERY TOUR:

  JWJ:
  - created arrays of size 2^n until n reached 27
  - recorded min, max, and average times for lin and bin searches
  - bin search time is always less than 1 millisecond
  - values of the arrays matched their indices
  -> bin search is faster than lin search
  
  AllBrians:
  - 1,000 trials of each lin and bin search with a random target each time
  - recorded min, max, and average times
  - recorded index of the search
  - didn't check the time if it's not in the array (didn't check for best/worst case scenarios)
  - created arrays by powers of 10
  - sometimes maxTime is larger than minTime (something interesting)
  -> bin search is faster than lin search in most cases
  
  Gamma Ray:
  - binary search is way too efficient
  - iterated through bin search 100 thousand times, and lin search 10 times
    -> nonetheless, bin search took far less time
  - tested for worst case scenario (is it always looking for the worst case scenario?)
  - binary search efficiency increased exponentially in comparison to linear search
  - averaged 50 trials for more accuracy in order to account for outliers/discrepancies
  - used (int) instead of (float) or (double) -> may lost important values in doing so
