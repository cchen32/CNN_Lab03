### Tests Performed
* We created several arrays of different lengths, 5 mil, 10 mil, 50 mil, and 100 mil; however, not all are present in the code due to heap size
* In both linAv and binAv, we cycled through a Comparable 100 times with the respective search, and noted the start and end times. These methods returned the difference in the start and end time, to see how long the search took.
### Results
