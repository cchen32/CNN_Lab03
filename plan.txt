Hypothesis to be tested: Relative to the size of the dataset, binary search is faster than linear search.

public static long currentTimeMillis() -> Returns the current time in milliseconds
Generate arraylists of different lengths, increasing exponentially
Ie: 10 → 100 → 1000 → 10000
Print the randomly generated arraylist (should be same for both linSearch and BinSearch)
Print array
Print time before searching, print time after searching → then find the difference
Print time and then print time again (just to find the time it takes to print time)
Subtract this twice from the difference
Do this twice: once for LinSearch, once for BinSearch
Run multiple times to get accurate results (or at least an average with Type A uncertainty) 
Find the average of the times (for each incrementation, for both LinSearch and BinSearch) -> look for any correlations regarding size of the arraylist
