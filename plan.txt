Hypothesis to be tested: Relative to the size of the dataset, binary search is faster than linear search.

- public static long currentTimeMillis() -> Returns the current time in milliseconds
- Generate arraylists of different lengths, increasing exponentially
    Ie: 10 → 100 → 1000 → 10000
- Set a variable equal to the time before searching, and another one equal to the time after searching
- Print the difference
- Do this twice: once for LinSearch, once for BinSearch
- Also run at index 0, middle, and last
- Run multiple times to get accurate results
- Find the average of the times (for each incrementation, for both LinSearch and BinSearch) -> look for any correlations regarding size of the arraylist
- Test on different devices
- Find type A uncertainty if we have time
